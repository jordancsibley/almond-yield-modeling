## Overview 

The purpose of this document is to practice building models and utilizing functions for environmental data. The goal is to implement a simple model of almond yield anomaly response to climate variables. The source of the function comes from the study, *Impacts of future climate change on California
perennial crop yields: Model projections with
climate and crop uncertainties* (Lobell et al. 2006). 

## Model Set Up 

### Inputs & Outputs 

- **Inputs**: daily times series of minimum, maximum daily temperatures and precipitation
- **Outputs**: maximum, minimum and mean yield anomoly for a input time series

## Function Overview 


## Running the Model 

### Load packages and data 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# Climate data 
data <- read.table("data/clim.txt", header = TRUE, sep = " ", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
